One hen,
Two ducks,
Three geese,
Four limerick oysters,
Five corpulent porpoises,
Six pairs of Don El Verso tweezers,
Seven Macedonians in full battle array,
Eight brass monkeys from the ancient, sacred crypts of Egypt,
Nine apathetic, sympathetic, diabetic old men with a marked propensity for procrastination and sloth, and
Ten lyrical, spherical, diabolical denizens of the deep who haul stall around the quo of the quay of the quivey,
all at the same time.
